# Responsive Web project

## Live Host

The project is hosted on http://karanagarwal.me/responsive-web-project.

## Description

Fast forward to the era where Digital Marketing has become an important aspect for every company. Even more so in the industries where new-age start ups are creating disruption with technology at their core. One such sector is the Food Delivery space.

So I decided to make a landing page for an imaginary food delivery start up named Omnifood and learn some aspects of good designing along the way.
This is a fully responsive website with which I learned the concepts of flat-UI designing, typography, colour schemes, etc.

It has many sections.

* features - to display the important features about the startup
* meals - to show some images of the menu items available
* steps - steps required to download their webapp
* cities - to tell the cities they are available in
* reviews - to showcase the customer reviews.
* plans - displaying the different plans they offer
* contact - serves as a medium to let people contact them
